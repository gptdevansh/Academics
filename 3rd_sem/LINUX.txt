LINUX ( 1991 'Linux tervalds' ) basicly open sourced kernel based UNiX .
why using : - open sources, multiuser, multitasking, security,portability.

Kernel = Kernel is core part of OS managing system resources and communication bw hardware and software.

UNIX - powerfull, multiuser, multitasking, operating system developed in 1970 at AT&T's Bell Labs.
IT is licensed.

Distros - An OS made from a software collection.
	CentOS, Ubuntu, Desbian, Xubuntu, kali Linux

hypervisor - virtualBox it share the hardware.
1.bare metal
2.hosted 

# :- root user
$ :- normal user

where can we remote my Linux?
putty, windows cmd, git bash etc. 

PuTTY: PuTTY is a free and open-source terminal emulator, serial console and network file transfer application. It supports several network protocols, including SCP, SSH, Telnet, rlogin, and raw socket connection. It can also connect to a serial port. The name "PuTTY" has no official meaning.

WinSCP :- for sharing file from your current working os to remote os.

LINUX FILE SYSTEM

every thing in Linux is file even the command also a file
save in -> usr/bin

-> OS store and manage data on disk or partitions using a structure called FileSysytem.
FileSystem includes files, directories and it's related permissions.

-> FS strores data in hierarchy of directories and files.

~ TYPES OF FILE SYSTEM :
-ext3
-ext4
-XFS (extended file system)
-FAT
-BTRFS (B-tree file system) 
etc.

 
?-how to check your Linux file system.
lsblk -f [cmnd]

-> XFS (Extended File System):
.XFS, 64bit high performance FS
.support parallel I/O operations
.Works well with large files

~
Each directory in Linux file system has a specific function, Some of a few key directories are listed below :

/ (root directory): The root directory is the top-level directory in the Linux file system. All other directories and files are contained within the root directory.

/bin: The /bin stands for binaries. This directory contains essential command-line tools and programs that are required for basic system administration tasks.

/boot: The /boot directory contains the boot loader files and kernel images needed to start the system.

/dev: The /dev directory contains device files that represent hardware devices and virtual devices such as terminals, printers, and disks.
/etc: The /etc directory contains system configuration files that are used by various applications and services on the system.

/home: The /home directory contains the home directories of users on the system. Each user has their own subdirectory within /home where they can store their personal files and settings.

/lib: The /lib directory contains shared library files that are needed by various programs on the system.

/media: The /media directory is used to mount removable media such as CDs, DVDs, and USB drives.

/mnt: The /mnt directory is used to mount file systems temporarily, such as network file systems or disk images.

/opt: The /opt directory is used to store additional software packages that are not part of the core system.

/proc: The /proc directory is a virtual file system that provides information about running processes and system resources.

/run: The /run directory contains temporary files that are created by system services and daemons.

/sbin: The /sbin directory contains system binaries and administrative tools that are required for system maintenance.

/srv: The /srv directory is used to store data for services provided by the system.

/sys: The /sys directory is a virtual file system that provides information about the system's hardware and devices.

/tmp: The /tmp directory contains temporary files that are created by applications and services running on the system.

/usr: The /usr directory contains user-level programs, libraries, documentation, and shared data files.

/var: The /var directory contains variable data files that change frequently, such as log files and system databases.

{ vi EDITOR } -
[
i - insert
o - insert on next line 
a - insert after a space
esc - escape out of any mode
:q! quit without saving
:wq! - quit and save
r - replace
d - delete 
u - undo

]

-{nano file editor}(easy to use)

- wildcards - 
A wildcard is a character that can be used as a substitute for any of a class of characters in a search.

*- zero or more characters
{
.create 10 file start with file1 : touch file{1..10}
to delete all files : rm file* (all files will delete starting with file)
.file end with .xml or other extention : ls -l *.xml
-> abc.xml  ghi.xml  fact.sh
}

?- single character
{
.files in which a single char diff : ls -l ?123
-> a123  b123  c123
: ls -l te?t
-> text  tect  tent  tept
.we can use multiple que mark in cmmnd : ls -l ???? (file have 4 car)
-> text tept dave 
}

[]- range characters 
{
.files in which char may be a, b, c : ls -l [abc]123
-> a123  b123  c123
}

que : cannd for list file's name have a char numeric
ans : ls -l *[0-9]* 

^ - beginning of line
{
.file data start with R
cat FILE_NAME | grep ^R
-> Ram  Raju  Ramesh  
}

$ - end of line
{
.file data end with sh : cat FILE_NAME | grep sh$ 
-> Devansh  Shivansh  
}

- grep command 
"Global Regular Expression Print"
.Grep cammand search for  a particular string/keyword from a file and print lines matching a pattern.
.It check line by line and print lines matching given pattern.
syntex : grep[option]..pettern[File]..
{
search a name in a file :
:grep NAME FILE_NAME  
 grep Nita csv1 
(this cmmnd also search words starting to given keyword)
:grep Ni csv1

1. to ignore the upper and lower case while searching 
:grep -i WORD FILE_NAME
 grep -i nita csv1

2. to search everything except given pattern/keyword
:grep -v WORD FILE_NAME

3. to print how many times a word present in file
:grep -c WORD FILE_NAME

4. to search exact match of a given file 
: grep -w WORD FILE_NAME

5. to print the line no. of matches of given keyword in a file
: grep -n WORD FILE_NAME

6 to search a given keyword in multiple files
:grep WORD FILE1 FILE2 FILE3 

7. to suppress file names while seach a given keyword in multiple  file
: grep -h WORD FILE1 FILE2

8. to seach multiple keyword in a file
: grep -e WORD1 -e WORD2 -e WORD3 FILE_NAME

 9. search multiple keyword in multiple file
: grep -e WORD1 -e WORD2 -e WORD3 FILE1 FILE2 FILE3

10. to print files nams which matches given keyword
: grep -l WORD FILE1 FILE2 FILE3

11. to get the keyword/pattern from a file and match with a another file
: grep -f keyword.txt FILE1 FILE2(names in keyword.txt search files)

11. to print the matching line which start with given keyword 
: grep "^WORD" FILE

12.  to print the matching line which end with given keyword 
: grep "WORD$" FILE_NAME

13. suppose we have 100 files in a dir. and we need to search a keyword in all the files 
: grep -R WORD DIR_NAME

14. we can use egrep cmmnd for the multiple keywords search 
: egrep "KEY1|KEY2|KEY3" FILE_NAME

=> BELOW CMMND MAY USE IN SHELL SCRIPTING TO CHECK CONDITION

15. if u jst wanna search but dont wanna print on terminal
: grep -q KEYWORD FILENAME (-q : quit)

16. if u wanna suppress error msg 
: grep -s KEYWOPD FILE_NAME

search dir : ls | grep WORD

 
}

=> sed -n 10 FILE_NAME (return 10 line of file)

find /path/ -name FILE_NAME

locate FILE_NAME (sudo updatedb) we have to updatecdb

history to see previous used command

--help attribute use to describe caoamnd


bc (use bc to use in terinal some small calculation)
(cntrl+c)

cal (to show calenter)
cal YEAR (year wise calender) cal jan 20223 

uptime ( how much times your machine is working and how many users are working )

script{
after use this cammnd it record all execution in a file ,
}cntrl + d (for exit ) it make a file name typescript.

alias (this command make a shortcut of any cmmnd)
ex :- alias l="ls -ltr"
alias -p (to check existing cmmnd)

wget (to dwnld a file from internet)
wget URL_OF _FILE
wget -o USERS_NAME URL

curl (call api cmnd)
curl http://numbersapi.com/random(random fact represent)

apt or yum/dnf (to install an application)

rmp -qa | grep APP_NAME (to check if an app is installed??)
dnf list installed

(to start/stop service)
systemctl start/stop/status SERVICE_NAME

(to list all services on linux)
systemctl lit-units --type=service --all

(list all enviroment varable)
printenv

(to add enviroment variable)(temprary)
export JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java_v"

to add env var permanently
source ~/.bash_profile

print 2nd clmn of csv file
awf -F, '{print $2}' NAME.csv 

cut -c1-2 NAME(to print 1 to 2 char)

sed -n '5p' NAME{to print 5th line}

sed -n 's/FROM/TO/g' NAME{FROM keyword change to TO keyword}
